# 👋 Hi, I'm Camilo Akle  
### **Senior Data Engineer | Cloud Data Architect | IoT & Agri-Tech Enthusiast**

I design and build **secure, scalable, cloud-native data platforms** on **GCP & AWS** that power analytics, AI, and real-time decision-making for fintech, telecom, and logistics companies.

🌱 Currently exploring the intersection of **data engineering, embedded systems (Arduino/PLC), and precision agriculture** to drive sustainable innovation.  
⚙️ Passionate about **Infrastructure as Code (Pulumi/Terraform)**, **event-driven architectures**, and **end-to-end data governance**.  
🤝 Open to collaborating on **cloud data projects**, **IoT integrations**, or **open-source tools** that solve real-world problems.

### 🌐 What I Bring to the Table
- ✅ **5+ years** building production-grade data pipelines & cloud data architectures  
- ✅ Expert in **GCP** (BigQuery, Cloud Composer, Dataflow, Pub/Sub, Secret Manager) and **AWS** (Redshift, Glue, Lambda, Step Functions)  
- ✅ Strong DevOps mindset: **CI/CD**, **Docker**, **GitHub Actions**, **Cloud Build**  
- ✅ Infrastructure as Code with **Pulumi** (GCP) and **Terraform** (AWS)  
- ✅ Experience with **serverless**, **streaming**, **data lakes**, and **BI integration** (Looker, Power BI)  
- ✅ Background in **financial analytics**, **credit risk**, and **operational intelligence**
